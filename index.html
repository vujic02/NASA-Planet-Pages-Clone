        <p><strong>Why Is It Called The "Solar" System?</strong>
          There are many planetary systems like ours in the universe, with planets orbiting a host star. Our planetary
          system is named the "solar" system because our Sun is named Sol, after the Latin word for Sun, "solis," and
          anything related to the Sun we call "solar."
